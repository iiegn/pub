this is a tex skeleton for thesis writing, Bsc., MSc., ... and it has been used for my theses at the University of Osnabrueck. 

for best results you will have to include some files in your local texmf tree; in case you have none you could use mine: 

svn checkout http://iiegn.iiegn.eu/svn/de.iiegn/usr/share/texmf

and link/copy it into you home directory to ~/texmf (most distributions will look there without further ado - windows users, however, should check their documentation...)


start with thesis.tex and work your way up through the \input statements.
have fun.


credits go to (at least):
 - Helmut Kopka and Patrick W. Daly for their 4th Edition of "Guide to LaTeX"
 - jss: https://coders.de/svn/uos/bsc/doc/internal/theses/ where you find his skeleton which i merged with my own...
