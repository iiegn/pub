Egon Stemle is a Cognitive Scientist: he studies skills like perception, thinking, learning, motor function, and language by combining the humanistic and analytical methods of the arts and the formal sciences.

His research focus within this relatively new `inter-discipline' lies in the area where Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence converge. He is working on computer aided fabrication of ontologies from large document repositories, the technological feasibility thereof and the utilization of cross-linked structured data in applications, and on tools for editing, processing, and annotating linguistic data.

His driving force is the question why humans handle incomplete and -- more often than not -- inconsistent structured concepts just fine, whereas computational processes are often of little avail or fail completely.
