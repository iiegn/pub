It introduces how containerization using Docker can help to meet these requirements and fleshes out the build and deployment workflow that CLARIN ERIC is employing to ensure that all the goals of their infrastructure are met in an efficient and sustainable way. In a second step, it is also shown how these same workflows can help researchers, especially in the fields of computational and corpus linguistics, to provide for more easily reproducible research by creating a virtual environment that can provide specific versions of data, programs and algorithms used for certain research questions and make sure that the exact same versions can still be used at a later stage to reproduce the results.},

    abstract = {Multilingual speakers communicate in more than one language in daily life and on social media. In order to process or investigate multilingual communication, there is a need for language identification. This study compares the performance of human annotators with automatic ways of language identification on a multilingual (mainly German-Italian-English) social media data set collected in Italy (i.e. South Tyrol). Our results indicate that humans and NLP systems follow their individual techniques to make a decision about multilingual text messages. This results in low agreement when different annotators or NLP systems execute the same task. In general, annotators agree with each other more than NLP systems. However, there is also variation in human agreement depending on the prior establishment of guidelines for the annotation task or not.},

    abstract = {Communication between humans via networked devices has become an everyday part of people's lives across different generations, cultures, geographical areas, and social classes. Shaped by the specific social and technical context in which it is produced, synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become increasingly participatory, interactive, and multimodal. User interactions and user-generated social media content offer a wide range of research opportunities for a growing multidisciplinary research community to examine themes that often relate to - but are not limited to - the interaction between language, CMC, and society. The ambition of this still-growing research community is for the research into CMC to be based on the availability of large, structured data sets, as is the case for many scientific communities. These data sets (corpora) are often built collaboratively from the work of different research teams and disseminated across the research community so that they may form the basis for new analyses and comparative or counter-analyses. With this in mind, in the mid-2000s, a growing number of projects started to collect and structure CMC corpora and diffuse these empirical resources that cover a broad range of CMC genres and languages to both the wider scientific community and business enterprises that develop approaches and tools for web mining, opinion and trend detection, semantic content analysis, or machine translation. Since 2013, the CMC and Social Media Corpora conference series1 has brought together researchers, principally in the fields of social sciences and digital humanities, with interests ranging from the collection, development of methodology, annotation, processing to the analysis of CMC corpora, and representatives of language resource infrastructure initiatives2 and business enterprises. Held annually, the conference series has helped animate discussions around the linguistic, technical, and ethical challenges involved in building and analysing CMC corpora and diffuse best practices across Europe and beyond concerning approaches, resources, tools, and methodologies when working with large collections of CMC data. The ambition has been to encourage researchers to diffuse the CMC corpora created by local project teams and facilitate dialogue that will help the community to work towards standards in building and using CMC corpora so as to encourage interoperability between the resources created within different research teams. Recent editions of the conference have also seen the inclusion of workshops organised as practical introductions to coding schemes for CMC data. The results of previous conferences have been published in the form of a special issue of the Journal of Language Technology and Computational Linguistics (Bei{\ss}wenger et al., 2014) and as monographs: Corpus de communication m{\'{e}}di{\'{e}}e par les r{\'{e}}seaux : Construction, structuration, analyse (Wigham {\&} Ledegen, 2017) and Investigating Computer-Mediated Communication: Corpus-Based Approaches to Language in the Digital World (Fi{\v{s}}er {\&} Bei{\ss}wenger, 2017). The call for papers for this edited volume was also open to authors who did not present papers at the conference. It includes seven contributions, all subject to double peer review, written by 14 authors from eight different institutions in seven countries. One paper is an original paper and the other six are extended papers from the 2017 edition of the CMC and Social Media Corpora Conference held in Bolzano, Italy. Online proceedings of all papers presented at the conference were published as an open-access resource (Stemle {\&} Wigham, 2017). The contributions to this edited volume include two methodological papers that focus on building and annotating CMC corpora and five contributions that offer a sociolinguistic analysis of different CMC corpora. In the latter contributions, distinct CMC genres are represented, including the social media platform Twitter, the social network Facebook, online newspapers and wikis (Wikipedia talk pages and Wikipedia articles). The volume is divided into three thematic sections: CMC Corpus repurposing, Language representation in CMC Corpora, and CMC Language use.},

    abstract = {The World Wide Web has become increasingly popular as a source of linguistic data, not only within the NLP communities, but also with theoretical linguists facing problems of data sparseness or data diversity. Accordingly, web corpora continue to gain importance, given their size and diversity in terms of genres/text types. The field is still new, though, and a number of issues in web corpus construction need much additional research, both fundamental and applied. These issues range from questions of corpus design (e.g., assessment of corpus composition, sampling strategies and their relation to crawling algorithms, and handling of duplicated material) to more technical aspects (e.g., efficient implementation of individual post-processing steps in document cleaning and linguistic annotation, or large-scale parallelization to achieve web-scale corpus construction). Similarly, the systematic evaluation of web corpora, for example in the form of task based comparisons to traditional corpora, has only recently shifted into focus. For almost a decade, the ACL SIGWAC (http://www.sigwac.org.uk/), and especially the highly successful Web as Corpus (WAC) workshops have served as a platform for researchers interested in compilation, processing and application of web-derived corpora. Past workshops were co-located with major conferences on computational linguistics and/or corpus linguistics (such as EACL, NAACL, LREC, WWW, and Corpus Linguistics). WAC-X also featured the final workshop of the EmpiriST 2015 shared task "Automatic Linguistic Annotation of Computer-Mediated Communication / Social Media" (see https://sites.google.com/site/empirist2015/ for details) and the panel discussion "Corpora, open science, and copyright reforms" (see https://www.sigwac.org.uk/wiki/WAC-X{\#}paneldisc for details).},

A particular question arising in the context of automated L1 identification is whether any features that are informative for a machine learning algorithm relate to L1-specific transfer phenomena. In order to explore this issue further, we discuss the results of a study carried out in the wake of a Native Language Identification Task. The task is based on the TOEFL11 corpus (cf. Blanchard et al. 2013), which involves a sample of 12,100 essays written by participants in the TOEFLÂ® test from 11 different language backgrounds (Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Telugu, and Turkish). The article will show our results in automatic L1 detection in the TOEFL11 corpus. These results are discussed in light of relevant transfer features which turned out to be particularly informative for automatic detection of L1 German and L1 Italian.},

    abstract = {Web corpora and other Web-derived data have become a gold mine for corpus linguistics and natural language processing. The Web is an easy source of unprecedented amounts of linguistic data from a broad range of registers and text types. However, a collection of Web pages is not immediately suitable for exploration in the same way a traditional corpus is. Since the first Web as Corpus Workshop organised at the Corpus Linguistics 2005 Conference, a highly successful series of yearly Web as Corpus workshops provides a venue for interested researchers to meet, share ideas and discuss the problems and possibilities of compiling and using Web corpora. After a stronger focus on application-oriented natural language processing andWeb technology in recent years with workshops taking place at NAACL-HLT 2010, 2011 andWWW2012 the 8thWeb as Corpus Workshop returns to its roots in the corpus linguistics community. Accordingly, the leading theme of this workshop is the application of Web data in language research, including linguistic evaluation of Web-derived corpora as well as strategies and tools for high-quality automatic annotation ofWeb text. The workshop brings together presentations on all aspects of building, using and evaluating Web corpora, with a particular focus on the following topics: applications of Web corpora and other Web-derived data sets for language research automatic linguistic annotation of Web data such as tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, lemma- tisation and semantic tagging (the accuracy of currently available off-the-shelf tools is still unsatisfactory for many types of Web data) critical exploration of the characteristics of Web data from a linguistic perspective and its applica- bility to language research presentation of Web corpus collection projects or software tools required for some part of this process (crawling, filtering, de-duplication, language identification, indexing, ...)},

    abstract = {In this article, we present the multi-faceted interface to the open PAIS\`{A} corpus of Italian. Created within the project PAIS\`{A} (Piattaforma per lâ€™Apprendimento dellâ€™Italiano Su corpora Annotati) [1], the corpus is designed to be freely available for non-commercial processing, usage and distribution by the public. Hence, this automatically annotated corpus (for lemma, part-of-speech and dependency information) is exclusively composed of documents licensed under Creative Commons (CC) licenses [2].The dedicated corpus interface is designed to provide flexible, powerful, and easy-to-use modes of corpus access, with the objective to support language learning, language practicing and linguistic analyses. We present in detail the interfaceâ€™s functionalities and discuss the underlying design decisions. We introduce the four principal components of the interface, describe supported display formats and present two specific features added to increase the interface's relevance for language learning. The main search components are (1) a basic search that adopts a "Google-style" search box, (2) an advanced search that provides elaborated graphical search options, and (3) a search that makes use of the powerful CQP query language of the Open Corpus Workbench [3]. In addition, (4) a filter interface for retrieving full-text corpus documents based on keyword searches is available. It is likewise providing the means for building temporary sub-corpora for specific topics. Users can choose among different display formats for the search results. Besides the established KWIC (KeyWord In Context) and full sentence views, graphical representations of the dependency relation information as well as keyword distributions are available. These dynamic displays are based on a visualisation for dependency graphs [4] and one for Word Clouds [5], which build on latest developments in information visualisation for language data. Two special features for novice learners are integrated into each search component. The first feature is a function for restricting search results to sentences of limited complexity. Search results are automatically filtered based on formal text characteristics such as sentence length, vocabulary, etc. The second is the supply of pre-defined search queries for linguistic constructions such as sentences in passive voice, questions, etc. Finally, we show how the PAIS\`{A} interface can be employed in different language teaching tasks. In particular, we present a complete unit of work aimed at learners of Italian (CEFR level A2/B1) and centered on studentsâ€™ direct use of the interface and its functionalities. By doing so, we are giving concrete examples for targeted searches and interactions with the provided language material, as well as an exemplification of how the use of the corpus can be integrated with communicative language activities in the classroom.},

    abstract = {Small, manually assembled corpora may be available for less dominant languages and dialects, but producing web-scale resources remains a challenge. Even when considerable quantities of text are present on the web, finding this text, and distinguishing it from related languages in the same region can be difficult. For example less dominant variants of English (e.g. New Zealander, Singaporean, Canadian, Irish, South African) may be found under their respective national domains, but will be partially mixed with Englishes of the British and US varieties, perhaps through syndication of journalism, or the local reuse of text by multinational companies. Less formal dialectal usage may be scattered more widely over the internet through mechanisms such as wiki or blog authoring. Here we automatically construct a corpus of Hiberno-English (English as spoken in Ireland) using a variety of methods: filtering by national domain, filtering by orthographic conventions, and bootstrapping from a set of Ireland-specific terms (slang, place names, organisations). We evaluate the national specificity of the resulting corpora by measuring the incidence of topical terms, and several grammatical constructions that are particular to Hiberno-English. The results show that domain filtering is very effective for isolating text that is topic-specific, and orthographic classification can exclude some non-Irish texts, but that selected seeds are necessary to extract considerable quantities of more informal, dialectal text.},
