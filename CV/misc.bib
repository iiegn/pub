    abstract = {This paper describes a revised and extended version of the KoKo corpus (version KoKo4, Dec 2015), a language resource of German L1 learner texts from three different German-speaking regions in different countries. The corpus is annotated with learner errors and linguistic annotations that are relevant to the the lexical level, and it also contains text-based evaluations of text quality. This paper extends and complements a previous paper in which we described a previous version (version KoKo3, Dec 2014). It thus briefly recalls previously discussed information while providing new information, especially with regards to the relevant differences between the two versions and the improvements they embody. Among other things, this abstract focuses on the latest improvements of the annotation schemata, provides additional quantitative figures, and describes the planned evaluation of the quality of the annotations through the evaluation of inter-annotator agreements.},
